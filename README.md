# Twenty


## Description

Twenty is a Chrome extension that helps you avoid eye strain! Did you know that [opthamologists recommend](https://advancedeyecaremd.net/20-20-20-tipstopreventeyestrain/) that during long periods of screen use, we look at something 20 feet away, every 20 minutes, for 20 seconds? The 20-20-20 rule has helped me personally with eye strain, and it also provides a great opportunity to take a small step back from your work and gather your thoughts.

## Acknowledgement 

Thanks to Google for getting me hooked on Chrome extensions with these simple and thorough instructions: [making your first extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/). Many thanks to the various answers on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) that helped me along the way. 



## Work In Progress

### Phase 2 - complete basic functionality:
- [x] make notifications appear via a timer instead of button-on-dom
- [x] when notification is closed, restart timer
- [x] display timer count on popup
- [x] display a message on the popup
- [x] add customization: ability to define duration of break and work times
- [ ] expand customization: minutes or seconds toggle


### Phase 3 - styling and UX:
- [x] add more instructions/feedback for user: e.g. when 'take a break' is clicked, should include a note about how to do 20-20-20, then *wait 20 sec*, then start the 20 min timer. 
- [x] add title and logo to popup and style
- [x] style popup button
- [ ] style settings sliders to match the rest of the popup
- [ ] update home icon to something more like a timer/clock
- [ ] research other extensions - need to add a description / homepage? maybe a ? icon 'about' type page next to the settings and timer?

### Phase 4 - polish and additional features:
- [ ] display some stat on the popup - how many times has user taken 20-20-20 breaks? streaks?
- [ ] add a pause button - see toucan toggle
- [ ] add link to 20-20-20 rule info in popup

### Stretch goals
- [ ] expand functionality for other types of breaks - stretching, water, exercise, sit/stand desk, etc?
