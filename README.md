# 20-20-20


## Description

20-20-20 is a chrome extension that reminds you to practice the [opthamologist recommendation](https://advancedeyecaremd.net/20-20-20-tipstopreventeyestrain/) that we look at something 20 feet away, every 20 minutes, for 20 seconds to prevent eye strain during long periods of screen use.
