# 20-20-20


## Description

20-20-20 is a chrome extension that reminds you to practice the [opthamologist recommendation](https://advancedeyecaremd.net/20-20-20-tipstopreventeyestrain/) that we look at something 20 feet away, every 20 minutes, for 20 seconds to prevent eye strain during long periods of screen use.

Phase 2 - complete functionality:
  *** see lines 12+ in popup.js for next steps
[x] make notifications appear via a timer instead of button-on-dom
[x] when notification is closed, restart timer
[x] display timer count on popup
[x] display a message on the popup


Phase 3 - enhance features:
[ ] add more instructions/feedback for user: e.g. when 'take a break' is clicked, should include a note about how to do 20-20-20, then *wait 20 sec*, then start the 20 min timer. 
[ ] display some stat on the popup - how many times has user looked (closed notification)?
[ ] add mad styling - notification customization, popup CSS
[.] add GFX - icon, more graphics for popup?
